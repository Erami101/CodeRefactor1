For this homework assignment I had to fix broken links by making sure every <a> had a closing tag after the link.
Change regular <div> tags to Semantic tags/sections such as <header> <section> or <main> and make sure to change the corresponding css tags.
I had to make sure all of the images were floating in the right direction and make sure the padding and margins were correct.
I also had to reduce the unnecessary spaces on the css page by grouping catagories together that had the same attributes like colors and sizes.
I also had to leave comments on both my html and css pages to let other devs understand my work.
